# csharp-automation-framework-playwright

## üöÄ Overview
This repository demonstrates a basic test automation framework in `C#` using `Playwright` for UI automation and `Reqnroll` for BDD. It integrates `NUnit` as the test runner and incorporates the following key components:

- .NET 8 for the core framework
- RestSharp for API testing
- Playwright for UI automation
- Extent Reports for HTML reporting
- MySQL for executing SQL test cases

### Key Features (in progress...)

- 5 Test Cases: Including 2 API, 1 UI, and 2 SQL-based tests.
- MySQL Initialization: Automated MySQL instance with seeded mock data and stored procedures for SQL validation.
- BDD Integration: Feature files and step definitions using Reqnroll.
- Docker-Based: Uses Docker Compose for setting up the MySQL environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **`Config/`**: contains:
  - SQL Setup: Docker Compose files and mock data (mock_data.sql) for MySQL test cases.
  - UI Locators: JSON file with element selectors used in Playwright tests.
---

## üìÑ BDD Feature Files
- **`Features/`**: BDD feature files for `reqnroll` used for RestApi, Sql, and UI test cases.

---

## üìÅ Source Code Overview
- **`Base`**: Base file used to initialize the test environment and provides shared configuration values for use across the framework.

- **`Fixtures/`**: Manages test environment setup and teardown for database,user interface, reports, and test configuration.

- **`Interfaces/`**: Contains abstract definitions for services and utilities used in tests.
 
- **`Helpers/`**: Contains utility functions such as `docker compose up/down` for Docker management.

- **`Reporting/`**: Extent Report classes to assist with reporting setup and initialization for test suite.

- **`Tests/`**: BDD tests, categorized into API, UI, and SQL.

- **`Hooks/`**: Contains `Reqnroll` hook files that define setup and teardown logic for ExtentReports and UserInterface.

---

## üìÑ HTML Reports
- **`Reports/`**: 
  - Auto-generated HTML reports using Extent Reports, saved in the `Reports` directory.
  - Screen captures in `SreenCaptures` directory with date/timestamp when an error is detected while running UI tests.

---

## üìÅ Test Types

  - API: Use RestSharp to validate public endpoints.
  - UI: Use Playwright with predefined locators.
  - SQL: Validate stored procedures and queries against seeded data.
---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- **Docker Desktop** (Windows) must be installed and running.

---

## üîÑ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:tdonaldson231/csharp-automation-framework-playwright.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd AutomationFrameworkRepo_v03
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Test Execution

### Environment Selection Precedence
1. Environment variable `testEnvironment` (highest priority)
2. Static value in the `Base` class (default: "dev")

### Using Visual Studio 2022
1. Open `AutomationFrameworkRepo_v03.sln`
2. Build the solution via `Build > Build Solution`
3. Run all tests via `Tests > Run All Tests`

### Using the `tests.sh` script to run `dotnet test`
Example running the `regression` tests in the `dev` environment:
```bash
$ bash tests.sh -e dev -c regression
```

### Building & Running Docker Image
1. Navigate to the root directory containing `Dockerfile`
2. Build the docker image: `docker build -t test-image .`
3. Run the docker image: `docker run --network sql_test-network -e TEST_ENV=dev -e TEST_CATEGORY=smoke test-image`\
**Note:** to allocate an interactive terminal (for shell access), execute the following:
```bash
> docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash <image-name:image-tag>
```

## üìÑ Additional Notes
- **Extent Reports**: Automatically generated after every test run.
- **Mock Data**: Seeded into MySQL using `mock_data.sql` during test initialization.
- **Locators**: Defined in `Config/UserInterface/locators.json` for UI tests.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting
- **Docker Not Running**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running before executing tests.
- **Environment Variable Issues**: Verify `testEnvironment` is correctly set for dynamic environment selection.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Azure DevOps 

A test container was built and executed using an Azure DevOps pipeline.  
The pipeline YAML file is located in the `AzureDevOps` directory for reference.

To run the pipeline, a self-hosted agent was configured by following the official Microsoft documentation:  
[Set up a self-hosted Windows agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/windows-agent?view=azure-devops&tabs=IP-V4)

The agent was set up and started using PowerShell with the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\agent> .\config.cmd

  ___                      ______ _            _ _

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Amazon CodePipeline 

The test container was also built and executed using an Amazon CodePipeline.  
The pipeline YAML file is located in the `AmazonCodePipeline` directory for reference.

The build was executed on Ubutu. 
It was necessary to enable the `Privileged` flag to build the Docker image with elevated privileges.
